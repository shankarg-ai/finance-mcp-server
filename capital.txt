# Integration of Working Capital, Accounts Payable (AP), and Accounts Receivable (AR): Optimization Approach

## Overview

This document describes how to connect and optimize Working Capital, Accounts Payable, and Accounts Receivable in a unified, data-driven framework. The approach ensures that AP and AR are managed as interdependent levers for maximizing liquidity, minimizing costs, and maintaining strong business relationships, rather than as isolated functions.

---

## 1. Unified Cash Flow Engine
- **Working Capital** optimization models all cash inflows and outflows, integrating AP (outflows), AR (inflows), and other short-term flows.
- **Cash Position at any time = Initial Cash + AR Collections + Other Inflows – AP Payments – Other Outflows**

## 2. Bidirectional Influence
- **AR Optimization**: Determines cash inflow timing via collection strategies, incentives, and risk management.
- **AP Optimization**: Determines cash outflow timing via payment scheduling, discount capture, and supplier relationship management.
- **Working Capital Optimization**: Orchestrates both, balancing acceleration of collections and delay of payments to optimize for liquidity, cost, or other objectives.

## 3. Shared Constraints and Objectives
- **Liquidity Constraint**: Cash must not fall below a critical threshold (or borrowing is triggered).
- **Cost Minimization**: Considers borrowing costs, missed discounts, late fees, and opportunity cost of idle cash.
- **Relationship Management**: Balances cash needs with supplier/customer relationship priorities.
- **Operational Flexibility**: Maintains buffer for shocks or opportunities.

## 4. Rolling Horizon & Scenario Planning
- All modules operate in a rolling horizon, re-optimizing as new data (invoices, payments, receipts, forecasts) arrives.
- Scenario analysis and robust optimization make the plan resilient to uncertainty (late payments, unexpected expenses, etc).

## 5. Feedback Loops
- **AP and AR recommendations** update continuously based on cash position and forecasts.
- The working capital module provides targets or constraints to AP/AR (e.g., "target X in collections this week," or "delay non-critical payments if cash buffer < Y").

## 6. User-Driven and Data-Driven Configuration
- Users can set objectives (liquidity, cost, relationships) and weights, or the system can recommend based on data analysis.
- Model can be tailored to prioritize maximizing discounts, minimizing borrowing, or maintaining customer satisfaction.

## Approach in Practice
- The **Working Capital module** is the “brain,” continuously analyzing liquidity needs and risk appetite.
- It instructs the **AP and AR modules** on optimal timing and strategy—e.g., when to accelerate collections, delay payments, or take/offer discounts.
- The system is data-driven, adaptive, and user-configurable, ensuring alignment with business goals and real-time conditions.

## Conclusion

This integrated approach ensures AP and AR are managed as coordinated levers for optimizing financial health, operational agility, and business relationships, under the strategic guidance of the Working Capital optimization engine.

# Mathematical Model for Dynamic Receivables Management

## Introduction

Receivables management is a cornerstone of effective working capital optimization, requiring a delicate equilibrium between accelerating cash collection and preserving valuable customer relationships. Companies frequently offer extended payment terms to drive sales and maintain competitiveness, but excessive extension of terms can significantly constrain cash flow and increase financing costs (Ernst & Young Working Capital Report, 2023). Conversely, enforcing strict collection practices may damage customer goodwill and potentially hamper future sales growth. This problem centers on determining optimal collection strategies for each customer invoice to maximize cash flow efficiency while strategically managing customer relationships. We develop a comprehensive mathematical optimization model to support these decisions over a rolling 90-day horizon, accounting for the specific characteristics of each invoice, the seller's cash position and forecasts, and incorporating uncertainty in both future cash flows and invoice generation.

## Problem Description

We consider a seller managing collections from multiple customers, each with several outstanding invoices. Each invoice carries specific attributes including an amount due, a due date (credit term), and potentially early payment incentives and/or late payment penalties. The seller maintains a current cash position and forecasts cash inflows and outflows for the next 90 days. Collection strategy decisions must be made for each invoice—determining what collection actions to take and when—such that all constraints are respected and the chosen objective is optimized. Key characteristics of the receivables management problem include:

### Multiple Invoices and Customers

Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the set of all invoices across all customers. Each invoice $i \in \mathcal{I}$ is associated with a customer (which influences prioritization or relationship considerations) and has a face amount $a_i$ and a due date $D_i$ by which payment is contractually expected. Unlike payables, receivables are not directly controlled by the company, making this an influence optimization problem rather than a direct scheduling problem. Collections can be scheduled on a daily basis over a planning horizon of 90 days (indexed as $t=1,\dots,90$, where $t=1$ is today). Various collection actions can be taken at different points in time, both before and after the due date $D_i$, with different probabilities of success and impact on customer relationships.

### Early Payment Incentives

To accelerate cash collection, companies may offer early payment discounts to customers, typically before some incentive deadline $E_i$ (e.g., 2/10 Net 30 means a 2% discount if paid within 10 days). Each invoice may have an associated discount rate $\delta_i$ (fraction of the amount) applicable if paid on or before $E_i < D_i$. Offering this discount reduces the expected collection amount to $a_i(1 - \delta_i)$. The model must capture the trade-off of offering discounts to accelerate cash versus maintaining full invoice value. Dynamic discounting may also be considered, where discount rates vary with time: $\delta_i(t)$ is decreasing as $t$ approaches $D_i$.

### Late Payment Penalties

If an invoice is paid after its due date $D_i$, the seller may charge a penalty or interest on the late payment per the sales agreement. We denote $\pi_i$ as the penalty rate (per day, or per period) for late payment of invoice $i$. For simplicity, assume a linear penalty: if paid $L$ days late (i.e., at time $t = D_i + L$), an additional amount of approximately $a_i \cdot \pi_i \cdot L$ is added to the expected collection. (Other penalty structures, such as a one-time flat fee or tiered penalties, can be accommodated with minor model adjustments.) The model accounts for these penalties in the expected collection amount if payments are projected to occur past due dates. Beyond financial penalties, late payments impose additional costs through collection efforts, financing the receivables gap, and potential accounting implications for bad debt provisions (PwC Working Capital Survey, 2024).

### Collection Effectiveness and Probability Modeling

Unlike payables where payment timing is directly controlled, receivables management involves influencing customer payment behavior through various collection actions. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of possible collection actions (e.g., sending payment reminders, making phone calls, offering discounts, imposing penalties, engaging collection agencies). Each action $j \in \mathcal{A}$ has:
- A cost $c_j$ to implement
- A probability of success function $p_j(i,t)$ that depends on the invoice $i$ and time $t$ relative to due date
- A relationship impact score $r_j$ indicating how the action affects customer relationships

The probability function $p_j(i,t)$ captures the likelihood that taking action $j$ for invoice $i$ at time $t$ will result in payment within a specified timeframe (e.g., 7 days). This function typically varies by customer segment, invoice size, historical payment patterns, and economic conditions.

    M["Monitor & Update Models"] --> A
```

### Cash Flow and Liquidity

The seller's cash position impacts strategic collection decisions and financing costs. Let $C_0$ be the initial cash available today. We have forecasts for daily cash inflows and outflows over the next 90 days (excluding the customer payments we are optimizing). Let $CF^+_t$ be the projected cash inflow on day $t$ (from non-AR sources) and $CF^-_t$ be the projected cash outflow on day $t$ for expenses. We must track the cash balance $C_t$ on each day $t$, which may require short-term borrowing if outstanding receivables create cash shortfalls. The cost of financing receivables (e.g., through factoring or drawing on a credit line) for the seller is considered at rate $r_s$. This financing cost is a key driver in determining how aggressively to pursue collections – the decision should compare the financing cost against the potential impact on customer relationships and future business.

    F --> H[Prioritize by Cost-Benefit]
    G --> I[Prioritize by Relationship Value]
    H --> J[Execute Collection Actions]
    I --> J
```

### Dynamic Decision-Making

Collection decisions are made sequentially over time with updating information. Each day, the firm can decide which collection actions to take for outstanding invoices given the latest information. We adopt a rolling 90-day horizon approach: at any decision point (e.g., today), consider all invoices and cash flows for the next 90 days, optimize the collection strategy, but implement only the near-term actions (e.g., actions for today or this week). As time advances and uncertainty resolves (e.g., payments received, new invoices issued), the horizon rolls forward and the optimization is solved again with updated data. This dynamic approach ensures adaptability to new information and uncertainty.

### Multiple Objectives

The model supports three distinct optimization goals (or "modes"), which may conflict with each other:

1. **Maximize Expected Cash Flow Value**: Focus on financial returns by maximizing the net present value of collections minus collection costs and financing costs. This objective yields the highest overall cash generation over the horizon.

2. **Optimize Customer Relationships**: Prioritize collection actions that maintain healthy customer relationships while still ensuring payment. This mode may sacrifice some cash acceleration to preserve customer satisfaction and future business potential.

3. **Minimize Financing Needs**: Reduce external financing requirements by accelerating collections strategically based on the seller's projected cash needs. This mode emphasizes timing of collections to align with the seller's outflow obligations.

In practice, a company might switch between these modes or seek a weighted combination depending on business conditions. The model can accommodate any one of these objectives at a time, or a weighted combination if needed.

## Key Model Components and Notation

To formalize the receivables management problem, we define the following sets, parameters, and decision variables. Table 1 summarizes the notation for the given data (inputs), and Table 2 defines the decision variables used in the model.

### Table 1. Key parameters and given data (inputs to the model):

| Symbol | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| $\mathcal{I}$ | Set of invoices (index $i \in \mathcal{I}$). Each invoice corresponds to a unique customer obligation. |
| $\mathcal{A}$ | Set of possible collection actions (index $j \in \mathcal{A}$). |
| $\mathcal{K}$ | Set of customer segments (index $k \in \mathcal{K}$) with different payment behaviors and strategic importance. |
| $a_i$ | Amount (face value) of invoice $i$ (currency units to be collected if no discounts/penalties). |
| $D_i$ | Due date of invoice $i$ (the last day without late penalty, relative to start of horizon). |
| $E_i$ | Early payment incentive deadline for invoice $i$ (if paid by this day, a discount applies). |
| $\delta_i$ | Early payment discount rate for invoice $i$ (fraction of $a_i$ reduced if paid by $E_i$). |
| $\pi_i$ | Late payment penalty rate for invoice $i$ (per day beyond $D_i$, as a fraction). |
| $c_j$ | Cost of implementing collection action $j$. |
| $p_j(i,t)$ | Probability that action $j$ on invoice $i$ at time $t$ results in payment within a defined timeframe. |
| $r_j$ | Relationship impact score of action $j$ (negative for adverse impact, positive for relationship building). |
| $CF^+_t$ | Forecasted cash inflow on day $t$ (for $t=1,\dots,90$), from non-AR sources. |
| $CF^-_t$ | Forecasted cash outflow on day $t$, for $t=1,\dots,90$. |
| $C_0$ | Initial cash available at the start of day 1 (today's cash position). |
| $r_s$ | Seller's cost of short-term borrowing (interest rate per day). |
| $\alpha_k$ | Strategic importance weight for customer segment $k$. |
| $h_i$ | Historical payment behavior score for the customer associated with invoice $i$. |
| $w_i$ | Probability that invoice $i$ becomes uncollectible (based on aging and customer risk profile). |

### Table 2. Decision variables (determined by the optimization):

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| $x_{i,j,t}$ | Binary decision variable, =1 if collection action $j$ is applied to invoice $i$ on day $t$, =0 otherwise. Multiple actions can be applied to the same invoice on different days. |
| $\mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}]$ | Expected payment amount for invoice $i$ on day $t$, based on collection actions taken and their probabilities of success. |
| $B_t$ | Nonnegative continuous variable for borrowed cash on day $t$ to cover any shortfall. |
| $C_t$ | Continuous variable representing the cash balance at end of day $t$. |
| $R_i$ | Continuous variable representing the expected relationship impact from collection actions on invoice $i$. |
| $M$ | Continuous variable representing the minimum cash balance over the horizon (used in the third objective mode). |

## Constraints and Relationships

The model's constraints ensure that the collection strategy is feasible with respect to action limitations, cash flow, and business rules. The main constraints are:

### Collection Action Limitations

Actions may have precedence requirements (e.g., a reminder must be sent before escalating to a call) and frequency limitations (e.g., no more than one call per week to a customer). We enforce these with:

$$\sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} x_{i,j,t} \leq 1, \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall t \in \{1,\dots,90\}$$

This ensures at most one action is taken per invoice per day.

For precedence requirements, we can define:

$$x_{i,j',t} \leq \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} x_{i,j,\tau}, \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}, \forall t \in \{2,\dots,90\}, \forall (j,j') \in \mathcal{P}$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of ordered pairs $(j,j')$ such that action $j$ must precede action $j'$.

### Expected Payment Timing

The expected payment timing based on collection actions determines the expected cash inflows. The probability of receiving payment for invoice $i$ on day $t$ depends on:
- Previous collection actions taken
- Days since invoice issuance
- Customer's historical payment behavior
- Current economic conditions

For each invoice $i$ and day $t$, we can model the expected payment amount as:

$$\mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}] = a_i \cdot \left(1 - \delta_i \cdot \mathbb{I}[t \leq E_i] + \pi_i \cdot \max(0, t - D_i) \right) \cdot p_{i,t}$$

where $p_{i,t}$ is the probability of payment on day $t$ given the collection actions taken up to that point, and $\mathbb{I}[t \leq E_i]$ is an indicator function equal to 1 if $t \leq E_i$ and 0 otherwise.

The probability $p_{i,t}$ can be modeled as:

$$p_{i,t} = \text{base}_{i,t} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \text{effect}(j, i, t-\tau) \cdot x_{i,j,\tau}$$

where $\text{base}_{i,t}$ is the baseline probability of payment without any collection actions, and $\text{effect}(j, i, t-\tau)$ is the incremental effect of taking action $j$ for invoice $i$, $t-\tau$ days after the action.

### Cash Balance Dynamics

The cash balance at the end of each day evolves from the previous balance plus inflows (including expected collections) minus outflows:

$$C_t = C_{t-1} + CF^+_t - CF^-_t + \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}] - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} c_j \cdot x_{i,j,t} + B_t$$

for each day $t$. Here, $\sum_{i} \mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}]$ is the expected total collections on day $t$, and $\sum_{i} \sum_{j} c_j \cdot x_{i,j,t}$ is the total cost of collection actions taken on day $t$.

### Cash Non-Negativity and Borrowing Limits

We typically require the cash balance not to go negative unless offset by borrowing:

$$C_t \geq 0, \quad \forall t = 1,\dots,90$$

We may also impose a borrowing limit:

$$B_t \leq B_{\text{max}}, \quad \forall t = 1,\dots,90$$

where $B_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum available credit line.

### Customer Relationship Impact

For each invoice $i$, we can define the cumulative relationship impact as:

$$R_i = \sum_{t=1}^{90} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} r_j \cdot x_{i,j,t}$$

We may enforce a minimum acceptable relationship impact for strategic customers:

$$R_i \geq R_{\text{min},k}, \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{I}_k, \forall k \in \mathcal{K}$$

where $\mathcal{I}_k$ is the set of invoices from customer segment $k$, and $R_{\text{min},k}$ is the minimum acceptable relationship score for that segment.

### Domain Constraints

All decision variables are restricted to valid ranges:

- $x_{i,j,t} \in \{0,1\}$ (binary) for all $i, j, t$.
- $\mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}] \geq 0$ for all $i, t$.
- $B_t \geq 0$ for all $t$.
- $C_t$ is a free continuous variable determined by the cash flow equation, but practically $C_t \geq 0$ will be enforced.
- $R_i$ is a free continuous variable.
- $M$ (minimum cash) is a free continuous variable bounded by $C_t$.

## Objective Functions

The model can be optimized with different objective functions depending on the strategic goal:

### 1. Maximize Expected Cash Flow Value

In this mode, the objective is to maximize the net present value of collections minus collection costs and financing costs:

$$\max Z_1 = \sum_{t=1}^{90} \frac{1}{(1+r_d)^t} \left( \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}] - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} c_j \cdot x_{i,j,t} - r_s \cdot B_t \right)$$

where $r_d$ is the daily discount rate for time value of money calculations.

This objective ensures that the optimizer will choose collection actions that maximize the expected net cash flow, considering the time value of money. It will prioritize higher-value invoices and invoices with higher collection probabilities, and will balance the cost of collection actions against their expected benefits.

### 2. Optimize Customer Relationships

In this mode, the goal is to maintain strong customer relationships while still ensuring effective collections. We can formulate this as:

$$\max Z_2 = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \alpha_{k(i)} \cdot \left( w_1 \cdot \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{90} \mathbb{E}[P_{i,t}]}{a_i} + w_2 \cdot \frac{R_i}{R_{\text{max},i}} \right)$$

where:
- $k(i)$ is the customer segment associated with invoice $i$
- $\alpha_{k(i)}$ is the strategic importance weight for that segment
- $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weights balancing collection effectiveness and relationship impact
- $R_{\text{max},i}$ is a normalization factor for the relationship score

This objective maximizes a weighted combination of collection effectiveness (as a percentage of invoice value) and normalized relationship impact, with higher weights for strategically important customers. It will prioritize maintaining good relationships with key customers while still collecting effectively.

### 3. Minimize Financing Needs

In this mode, the focus is on reducing the need for external financing by optimizing the timing of collections to match outflow needs:

$$\max Z_3 = M - w_3 \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{90} B_t$$

where:
- $M$ is the minimum cash balance over the horizon, defined by $M \leq C_t$ for all $t$
- $w_3$ is a weight balancing the two components

This objective maximizes the minimum cash balance while minimizing the total borrowing, ensuring that collections are timed to prevent cash shortfalls as much as possible. It will prioritize accelerating collections before major outflow periods and may be less aggressive when cash position is comfortable.

## Implementation and Practical Considerations

### Rolling Horizon Approach

The model is designed for implementation in a rolling horizon framework:

1. At the start of each day or week, update the data (invoice status, cash position, forecasts).
2. Run the optimization model for the next 90 days.
3. Implement only the collection actions for the current day or week.
4. Advance time, observe outcomes, and repeat.

Through this approach, the model remains responsive to new information and changing conditions. The feedback loop of forecast → optimize → act → observe → re-optimize helps manage uncertainty and keeps the planning horizon moving forward.

    B --> C[Implement Current Day/Week Actions]
    C --> D[Observe Outcomes]
    D --> E[Advance Time]
    E --> A
```

### Incorporating Uncertainty in Forecasts

Uncertainty is inherent in receivables management: customers may pay earlier or later than expected, collection actions may have varying effectiveness, and cash needs may change. The model can handle uncertainty through:

#### Stochastic Optimization

We can formulate the problem as a stochastic program by considering multiple scenarios for:
- Payment timing and probabilities
- Collection action effectiveness
- Cash inflows and outflows

This allows us to optimize for expected outcomes across scenarios, potentially with risk considerations.

#### Safety Buffers

A simpler approach is to incorporate safety buffers:
- Require a minimum cash cushion: $C_t \geq C_{\text{min}}$
- Be conservative in estimating collection probabilities
- Limit reliance on expected collections for critical expenses

#### Scenario Analysis

Even with a deterministic model, we can run multiple scenarios to understand sensitivities and develop contingency plans for adverse conditions.

## Extending the Model with Strategic Factors

The core model can be enhanced with additional strategic considerations:

### Customer Segmentation and Value

Not all customers have equal strategic value. The model can incorporate customer segmentation by:
- Setting segment-specific weights in the relationship objective
- Imposing segment-specific constraints on collection actions
- Developing segment-specific probability models for payment behavior

For high-value customers, the model might be more conservative in collection actions, while for transactional customers, it might prioritize cash acceleration.

### Credit Risk and Deterioration Patterns

The model can incorporate credit risk assessments:
- Higher collection urgency for customers showing financial distress
- Adjusted probability models based on aging and risk indicators
- Explicit modeling of expected loss given default

```mermaid

    A[Aging Buckets] --> B[Risk Assessment]

    D[External Credit Data] --> B
    B --> E[Collection Priority]
    B --> F[Expected Loss Model]
    E --> G[Action Selection]
    F --> G
```

### Market Conditions

Economic conditions can significantly impact collection strategies:
- In tight credit markets, accelerating collections becomes more valuable as financing costs rise
- During economic downturns, customer relationship preservation may take precedence
- Industry-specific cycles may affect optimal timing of collection pressure

The model parameters ($r_s$, action probabilities, etc.) can be adjusted to reflect current market conditions.

### Integration with Credit Policies

The receivables optimization model should work in concert with credit policy decisions:
- Credit limits and terms offered to customers affect future receivables
- Collection performance should feed back into credit decisioning
- The model can identify customers where credit terms should be revisited

### Specialized Collection Techniques

Advanced collection approaches can be incorporated:
- Factoring or supply chain financing options
- Early payment discount optimization
- Settlement negotiation strategies for problematic accounts

Each approach can be modeled as specific actions with associated costs, probabilities, and relationship impacts.

## Performance Metrics and Monitoring

To evaluate the effectiveness of the receivables optimization model, several key metrics should be tracked:

### Financial Performance Indicators

- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: Average collection period for accounts receivable
- **Aging Bucket Distribution**: Percentage of receivables in each aging category
- **Bad Debt Ratio**: Write-offs as a percentage of total receivables
- **Collection Effectiveness Index (CEI)**: Measures how effectively past due receivables are being collected

### Operational Metrics

- **Action-to-Collection Conversion**: Success rates of different collection actions
- **Time-to-Payment After Action**: Average days to payment following specific actions
- **Cost-per-Dollar-Collected**: Collection costs divided by amounts collected
- **Action Volume by Type**: Frequency of different collection actions used

### Customer Impact Measures

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Feedback on collection experience
- **Retention Rates**: By collection strategy segment
- **Future Purchase Behavior**: Correlation with collection approaches used

Regular monitoring of these metrics enables continuous refinement of the model parameters and approach.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive mathematical model for dynamic receivables management provides a robust framework for optimizing collection strategies. By balancing financial returns, customer relationships, and cash flow needs, companies can transform accounts receivable from a passive function to a strategic working capital optimization tool.

The model's key strengths include:
- Mathematical rigor in capturing the complexities of the receivables management problem
- Multiple strategic objectives to align with corporate priorities
- Explicit consideration of customer relationships and long-term value
- Dynamic adaptation through rolling horizon implementation
- Incorporation of uncertainty and risk management techniques

When implemented effectively, this approach can generate significant working capital improvements while preserving valuable customer relationships. It transforms traditional collections into a data-driven, strategically aligned business process that contributes directly to corporate financial objectives.

By applying this model, companies can expect to reduce DSO, lower financing costs, improve cash flow forecasting accuracy, and ultimately optimize their entire cash conversion cycle – all while maintaining or even enhancing customer relationships.

# Mathematical Model for Integrated Working Capital Optimization

## Introduction

Working capital optimization is the strategic management of a company’s short-term assets and liabilities to ensure liquidity, minimize financing costs, and maximize operational flexibility. It acts as the glue between Accounts Payable (AP), Accounts Receivable (AR), and other short-term operational flows (e.g., inventory, short-term debt), enabling organizations to balance cash inflows and outflows, maintain supplier and customer relationships, and achieve financial resilience.

This document presents a comprehensive, robust, and modular optimization framework for working capital, integrating both payables and receivables management. It is designed to be exhaustive and configurable, allowing companies to tailor objectives and constraints to their unique circumstances, and enabling best-practice recommendations based on available data.

---

## Problem Statement

The integrated working capital optimization problem involves simultaneously managing:
- **Accounts Payable**: Timing and prioritization of payments to suppliers
- **Accounts Receivable**: Collection strategies and incentives for customer payments
- **Other Short-Term Flows**: Inventory, short-term debt, and operational cash flows

The goal is to determine optimal strategies for AP and AR (and optionally inventory and financing), balancing:
- Liquidity (ensuring sufficient cash to meet obligations)
- Cost minimization (reducing cost of capital and transaction costs)

## Constraints

### Receivables (AR) Dynamics
- Each invoice can have multiple collection actions, with probabilities of payment depending on action sequence and timing
- Expected AR inflows at time $t$ in scenario $s$:
  $$ \mathbb{E}[AR_{t,s}] = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_R} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}_R} a_i \cdot p_j(i, t, s) \cdot x_{i,j,t,s} $$

### Payables (AP) Dynamics
- Each invoice can have multiple payment actions (timing, discount, delay)
- Expected AP outflows at time $t$ in scenario $s$:
  $$ \mathbb{E}[AP_{t,s}] = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{I}_P} \sum_{l \in \mathcal{A}_P} b_k \cdot q_l(k, t, s) \cdot y_{k,l,t,s} $$

### Cash Flow Evolution
- For each $t, s$:
  $$ C_{t,s} = C_{t-1,s} + CF^+_t(s) - CF^-_t(s) + \mathbb{E}[AR_{t,s}] - \mathbb{E}[AP_{t,s}] + B_{t,s} $$

### Borrowing and Liquidity
- $C_{t,s} \geq 0$ (or $B_{t,s}$ covers any shortfall)
- $B_{t,s} \leq B_{max}$

### Action Frequency and Precedence
- Limits on how often actions can be taken (e.g., no more than one reminder per week)
- Precedence rules (e.g., reminder before escalation)

### Relationship and Risk Constraints
- Minimum satisfaction scores for key customers/suppliers
- Maximum risk exposure per counterparty

### Domain Constraints
- $x_{i,j,t,s}, y_{k,l,t,s} \in \{0,1\}$
- $B_{t,s}, C_{t,s}, M_s \geq 0$

## Objective Function (Configurable & Multi-Objective)

The model supports a weighted, user-configurable objective:

$$
\max Z = \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Liquidity}] - \beta \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Financing Cost}] - \gamma \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Transaction Cost}] + \theta \cdot \mathbb{E}[\text{Relationship Score}]
$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{E}[\text{Liquidity}]$: Expected minimum cash buffer across scenarios
- $\mathbb{E}[\text{Financing Cost}]$: Expected borrowing cost
- $\mathbb{E}[\text{Transaction Cost}]$: Cost of AR/AP actions
- $\mathbb{E}[\text{Relationship Score}]$: Weighted satisfaction across customers and suppliers
- Weights $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \theta$ are set by the user or recommended by the system based on data

---

## Robust Optimization and Scenario Analysis

- Model supports multiple scenarios for cash flows, payment/collection probabilities, and external shocks
- Robust optimization: maximize minimum performance across scenarios, or minimize regret
- Safety buffers and user-defined risk tolerance
- User can input scenarios or use system-generated ones (e.g., macroeconomic, seasonality, supply chain disruptions)

---

## Modular Design & User Configuration

- **Payables Module**: Detailed AP optimization (see payable_problem_statement)
- **Receivables Module**: Detailed AR optimization (see receivable_problem_statement)
- **Working Capital Module**: Integrates AP, AR, and cash/borrowing for holistic optimization
- User can choose objectives, set weights, define constraints, and input custom scenarios
- System can recommend ideal objectives and parameterization based on data analysis
